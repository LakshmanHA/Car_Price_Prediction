This is a 7 steps process.we need to come from scratch like,from Feature Enguneering to Model Prediction.
# Dependencies
we don't need any extra dependencies ,Google Colab is enough for this problem.
# Step-1 & 2
First We need to import all the required modules and data required for our problem
# Step-3 & 4
-> converted total data into numeric values  
-> eliminated some columns which doesnâ€™t show any impact on the dependent variable eg:car_company, model_id.  
-> encoded some categorical variables eg:feature1,  feature2.  -> and also performed one hot encoding on some columns eg:fuel, car_type.  -> finally converts any negatives in our dataset to zero
